Thanks to robot maker Sphero, fans can buy their very own version of BB-8, one of the astromech droids from the movie. \t \tI got my hands one of the new BB-8 robots, and after taking it for a test drive I wanted to find what makes it work as well as what makes it different from Sphero's other rolling robots. \tAlthough the BB-8 has a fancy droid paint job, a movable head piece and a new charging base, it's very similar to the Sphero and Sphero 2 (SPRK Edition shown here). The BB-8 measures 2.9-inches in diameter, stands 4.5-inches tall and weighs about 7 ounces. \t \tWhat really sets this robot apart from earlier Sphero products is the new Sphero BB-8 app, available on iOS and Android. Using the app, you can drive the BB-8 just like you would a regular Sphero, issue voice commands, have the unit follow pre-programmed commands (such as patrol) and even record as well as play messages that the app makes look like the holographic communications used in the Star Wars movies. \tBut just how different is the BB-8 from the older Sphero 2? To find out, we'll need to crack it open.Cracking Open the Sphero BB-8  \tUnfortunately, there's no way to get inside the BB-8 without cutting through the hard, polycarbonate shell. I could have used a hacksaw or other blade, but chose to go with a rotary cutting tool and a diamond wheel. I also wore safety glasses and gloves. \t \tWith the BB-8 secured in a vice, I carefully cut around the middle of the sphere. I made sure not to insert the cutting wheel too deep inside the robot and damage any of the internal components. After a few minutes, I had sliced the outer shell into two halves. \tOnce inside the BB-8 shell, I was able to lift out the internal hardware, which is comprised of a plastic frame holding the circuit board, motors, drive gears, batteries and charging coil. \t \tThe internal design of the BB-8 is very similar to that of the Sphero 2, with the addition of a mast that extends up from the center of the frame. Two magnets are located at the top of the mast. These magnets hold the BB-8's head in place and allow it to move as the robot rolls. \tTo dissect the internals, I first removed the mast with attached magnets. After removing a pair of Phillips screws, I removed the main system board. \tOn the board, we find the BB-8's brain, an ST Micro STM32 F3 MCU, which includes a 72MHz 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 core. There's also a CSR 1010 Bluetooth chip, ST Micro M24512-R 512 Kbit serial EEPROM, HUATAI HT6292 battery charger, gyroscope and accelerometer. \t \tNext, I removed another pair of screws and part of the internal plastic body that covered the motors and batteries. A thin plastic piece that covers the batteries was next and then the two 3.7V 350mAh Li-ion batteries. \tThe BB-8's two Standard Motor FP13-KT electric motors, drive wheels and axles came out next. And finally, I removed the receiver coil for the inductive charging system. \tWith our BB-8 looking a little like C-3PO after a visit to Cloud City, the teardown was complete. \tWhat the teardown tells us \tThe Sphero BB-8 is basically a modified Sphero 2 with lots of Star Wars-themed add-ons, including the app. \tThe only two significant internal differences that I observed between the two robots were the mast and magnet assembly used for the BB-8's head and a missing chip on the BB-8's system board. The Sphero SPRK Edition has an ST Micro STM32F-100 MCU on the system board in addition to the main MCU. I suspect this extra chip helps the SPRK, which is designed to teach kids about robotics and coding, actually run the programs written by users. \tAll in all, the BB-8 was a lot of fun to crack open and even more fun to use. As Michelle Starr wrote in her   , the \"Sphero BB-8 is the 'Star Wars' toy you're looking for.\"","speakable":{"@type":"SpeakableSpecification","cssSelector":[".speakableText",".article-dek",".speakableTextP1",".speakableTextP2"]}}</script>

    <p> 	I got my hands one of the new BB-8 robots, and after taking it 
for a test drive I wanted to find what makes it work as well as what 
makes it different from Sphero's other rolling robots.</p><p> 	Although 
the BB-8 has a fancy droid paint job, a movable head piece and a new 
charging base, it's very similar to the Sphero and Sphero 2 (<a href="http://www.sphero.com/sphero-sprk" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" data-component="externalLink">SPRK Edition</a> shown here). The BB-8 measures 2.9-inches in diameter, stands 4.5-inches tall and weighs about 7 ounces.</p><figure class="image image-large pull-none hasCaption shortcode" section="shortcodeImage"><span class="imageContainer"><span><img src="Sphero%20BB-8%20teardown%20reveals%20its%20robot%20tech%20inside%20the%20rolling%20'Star%20Wars'%20droid%20-%20CNET_files/spherobb8teardown007.webp" class="" alt="spherobb8teardown007.jpg" width="1092" height="0"></span></span><figcaption><span class="caption">From left to right: Sphero SPRK Edition, Sphero BB-8 and Sphero.</span><span class="credit">

 	What really sets this robot apart from earlier Sphero products is the 
new Sphero BB-8 app, available on iOS and Android. Using the app, you 
can drive the BB-8 just like you would a regular Sphero, issue voice 
commands, have the unit follow pre-programmed commands (such as patrol) 
and even record as well as play messages that the app makes look like 
the holographic communications used in the Star Wars movies.</p><p> 	But just how different is the BB-8 from the older Sphero 2? To find out, we'll need to crack it open.</p><h3>Cracking Open the Sphero BB-8 </h3><p>
 	Unfortunately, there's no way to get inside the BB-8 without cutting 
through the hard, polycarbonate shell. I could have used a hacksaw or 
other blade, but chose to go with a rotary cutting tool and a diamond 
wheel. I also wore safety glasses and gloves.</p><figure class="image image-large pull-none hasCaption shortcode" section="shortcodeImage"><span class="imageContainer"><img src="Sphero%20BB-8%20teardown%20reveals%20its%20robot%20tech%20inside%20the%20rolling%20'Star%20Wars'%20droid%20-%20CNET_files/spherobb8teardown002_002.webp" class="" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1092" height="0"><noscript><img src="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/ttal9YT56AoDkTPtV-z0GnrkD90=/204x0:972x576/1092x0/2015/09/05/3af6bc75-cdad-4172-80e8-4389e32b0356/spherobb8teardown002.jpg" class="" alt="" height="0" width="1092"></noscript></span><figcaption><span class="caption">Cutting open the Sphero BB-8's polycarbonate shell.</span><span class="credit">

 	With the BB-8 secured in a vice, I carefully cut around the middle of 
the sphere. I made sure not to insert the cutting wheel too deep inside 
the robot and damage any of the internal components. After a few 
minutes, I had sliced the outer shell into two halves.</p><p> 	Once 
inside the BB-8 shell, I was able to lift out the internal hardware, 
which is comprised of a plastic frame holding the circuit board, motors,
 drive gears, batteries and charging coil.</p><figure class="image image-large pull-none hasCaption shortcode" section="shortcodeImage"><span class="imageContainer"><img src="Sphero%20BB-8%20teardown%20reveals%20its%20robot%20tech%20inside%20the%20rolling%20'Star%20Wars'%20droid%20-%20CNET_files/spherobb8teardown004.webp" class="" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1092" height="0"><noscript><img src="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/6XH_zv4JinokPFBtMDhz6azh2og=/145x1:848x528/1092x0/2015/09/05/4218ff3a-d1c0-436c-869c-9e3d6d8b2576/spherobb8teardown004.jpg" class="" alt="" height="0" width="1092"></noscript></span><figcaption><span class="caption">Removing the Sphero BB-8's internal hardware.</span><span class="credit">

 	The internal design of the BB-8 is very similar to that of the Sphero 
2, with the addition of a mast that extends up from the center of the 
frame. Two magnets are located at the top of the mast. These magnets 
hold the BB-8's head in place and allow it to move as the robot rolls.</p><p>
 	To dissect the internals, I first removed the mast with attached 
magnets. After removing a pair of Phillips screws, I removed the main 
system board.</p><p> 	On the board, we find the BB-8's brain, an ST 
Micro STM32 F3 MCU, which includes a 72MHz 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 core. 
There's also a CSR 1010 Bluetooth chip, ST Micro M24512-R 512 Kbit 
serial EEPROM, HUATAI HT6292 battery charger, gyroscope and 
accelerometer.</p><figure class="image image-large pull-none hasCaption shortcode" section="shortcodeImage"><span class="imageContainer"><img src="Sphero%20BB-8%20teardown%20reveals%20its%20robot%20tech%20inside%20the%20rolling%20'Star%20Wars'%20droid%20-%20CNET_files/spherobb8teardown005.webp" class="" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1092" height="0"><noscript><img src="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/OXq4GBYLDAEvTOm-tWaI_dXv6gA=/133x0:901x576/1092x0/2015/09/05/40b7a7fa-5e12-4511-9276-a76b34654a55/spherobb8teardown005.jpg" class="" alt="" height="0" width="1092"></noscript></span><figcaption><span class="caption">Removing the Sphero BB-8 main system board.</span><span class="credit">

 	Next, I removed another pair of screws and part of the internal 
plastic body that covered the motors and batteries. A thin plastic piece
 that covers the batteries was next and then the two 3.7V 350mAh Li-ion 
batteries.</p><p> 	The BB-8's two Standard Motor FP13-KT electric 
motors, drive wheels and axles came out next. And finally, I removed the
 receiver coil for the inductive charging system.</p><p> 	With our BB-8 looking a little like C-3PO after a visit to Cloud City, the teardown was complete.</p><figure class="image image-large pull-none hasCaption shortcode" section="shortcodeImage"><span class="imageContainer"><img src="Sphero%20BB-8%20teardown%20reveals%20its%20robot%20tech%20inside%20the%20rolling%20'Star%20Wars'%20droid%20-%20CNET_files/spherobb8teardown001.webp" class="" alt="spherobb8teardown001.jpg" loading="lazy" width="1092" height="0"><noscript><img src="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/haUmHZeq2IliOuWeUVk5TvvMwQk=/1092x0/2015/09/05/cd599e3e-3dbb-4c55-bb7c-39d79e7168f2/spherobb8teardown001.jpg" class="" alt="spherobb8teardown001.jpg" height="0" width="1092"></noscript></span><figcaption><span class="caption">The BB-8 is dissected.</span><span class="credit">

 	The only two significant internal differences that I observed between 
the two robots were the mast and magnet assembly used for the BB-8's 
head and a missing chip on the BB-8's system board. The Sphero SPRK 
Edition has an ST Micro STM32F-100 MCU on the system board in addition 
to the main MCU. I suspect this extra chip helps the SPRK, which is 
designed to teach kids about robotics and coding, actually run the 
programs written by users.</p><p> 	All in all, the BB-8 was a lot of fun to crack open and even more fun to use. As Michelle Starr wrote in her  <span class="link" section="shortcodeLink"><a href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/sphero-bb-8-preview/">CNET hands-on</a></span> , the "Sphero BB-8 is the 'Star Wars' toy you're looking for."</p>

that don't have final answers yet: When could you start receiving your 
Child Tax Credit checks, and how often would you get them? We'll explain
 that and more below. Here's more information about <span class="link" section="shortcodeLink"><a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/300-bonus-unemployment-checks-when-do-extra-payments-go-out-what-you-should-know/">unemployment benefits</a></span> in the new bill and what we know so far about whether a <span class="link" section="shortcodeLink"><a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/fourth-stimulus-check-heres-how-more-money-could-come-in-2021/">fourth stimulus check</a></span> could happen. This story was recently updated.</p><h2>When will your Child Tax Credit payments start arriving?</h2><p>While the <span class="link" data-track="anchorLink"><a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/new-stimulus-bill-provides-more-than-1-check-heres-every-way-you-get-money/" data-component="linkTracker" data-link-tracker-options="{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link_anchor&quot;}">American Rescue Plan</a></span>
 specifies that the CTC payments will begin arriving in July, a date 
hasn't been released yet. The IRS will make additional information about
 the expanded Child Tax Credit available "as soon as possible," the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-statement-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">agency said in a statement March 12</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In
 the same statement, the IRS urged taxpayers not to file an amended 
return related to the new legislation and not to take any other 
"unnecessary steps."&nbsp;</p><figure class="shortcode chart type_geekboxchart" section="shortcodeGeekboxChart">

<p>IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig said that payments will be automatic for those who <span class="link" section="shortcodeLink"><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/tax-day-extended-to-may-17-everything-you-need-to-know-now/">file their 2020 tax returns by May 17</a></span>, the new tax deadline.</p><p>However, <span class="link" section="shortcodeLink"><a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/nonfilers-and-stimulus-checks-6-things-to-know-if-you-never-file-taxes/">nonfilers will need to file a tax return</a></span> to get the credit, even if they don't usually submit tax returns.&nbsp;</p><h2>How frequently will you get a CTC payment?</h2><p>The
 idea is for the Child Tax Credit to be paid out "periodically," 
according to the text of the stimulus bill, from July through December. 
However, the IRS is still working to determine how often it will be able
 to get the checks out -- and if that could even hit a monthly 
distribution.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked if the agency would be able to 
start making payments in July, Rettig said that "that time frame might 
change in some manner" but that the agency is committed to hitting the 
goal. "I think it might be a challenge to get into the monthly, right 
out of the box," he said.</p><p>The amount you'd receive would be half 
of what you're owed for the year, under the new stimulus bill, and 
you'll receive the other half of the payment with your <span class="link" section="shortcodeLink"><a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/taxes/hey-irs-wheres-my-refund-heres-how-to-track-your-2020-tax-return-status/">2021 tax refund</a></span>.</p><p>If
 paid out monthly, the payments would break down to up to $300 per month
 for each qualifying child age 5 and under, and up to $250 per month for
 each child between the ages of 6 and 17. Note that this amount phases 
out for those with higher incomes -- for single people earning more than
 $75,000 per year, heads of household earning more than $112,500 per 
year and married couples earning more than $150,000 a year.</p><figure class="shortcode chart type_geekboxchart" section="shortcodeGeekboxChart">

    <h2>Will the IRS open an online portal where I can fix any errors?</h2><p>The
 IRS is working on creating an online portal for the advanced credit, 
Powell said. The goal is to have the portal launched by July 1, <a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/legislation/hearings/oversight-subcommittee-hearing-irs-commissioner-2021-filing-season" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">Rettig said during the subcommittee meeting</a>, but the IRS won't have the resources until after tax filing season ends.</p><p>Once
 the CTC portal is available, recipients can log in to update their 
information if their circumstances have changed. For example, if you 
have a child in 2021, the IRS wouldn't have that information on file 
yet, so updating those details could help you get a higher payment.</p><h2>What's the plan after the payments end?</h2><p>The
 final payment of the Child Tax Credit is scheduled to end by Dec. 31, 
2021. President Joe Biden, however, wants to make the higher payments 
permanent, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/03/16/press-gaggle-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-aboard-air-force-one-en-route-chester-pa/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" data-component="externalLink">White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday</a>: "We're having those discussions with Congress."</p><figure class="image image-large pull-none hasCaption shortcode" section="shortcodeImage"><span class="imageContainer"><img src="Sphero%20BB-8%20teardown%20reveals%20its%20robot%20tech%20inside%20the%20rolling%20'Star%20Wars'%20droid%20-%20CNET_files/022-cash-money-third-stimulus-checks-biden-federal-unemploy.webp" class="" alt="022-cash-money-third-stimulus-checks-biden-federal-unemployment-1400-300-payments" loading="lazy"><noscript><img src="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/AGMN7h0fWm18HdpyGT3BMmZdr5M=/2021/03/16/9e587dfb-9b71-4c9d-8b96-9adc8cf76a64/022-cash-money-third-stimulus-checks-biden-federal-unemployment-1400-300-payments.jpg" class="" alt="022-cash-money-third-stimulus-checks-biden-federal-unemployment-1400-300-payments"></noscript></span><figcaption><span class="caption"><p>It's unclear if the payments will become permanent.</p></span><span class="credit">

 If you receive more money than you should have, you will have to pay it
 back. Powell explained that when you file your 2021 tax return (in 
2022), if your tax situation isn't what the IRS has in its system, and 
you weren't entitled to as much as you received, you'll have to give the
 overpayment back.&nbsp;</p><p>To avoid this tax inconvenience, make 
sure all of your information is updated before the payments start 
arriving. Powell estimates the portal will be open ahead of time so you 
can make any necessary adjustments.</p><h2>Can I get all my money as a lump sum instead of as separate checks?</h2><p>Absolutely,
 but not this year. If you thought you could cash in on all the CTC 
money in July, that's not the case. Instead, you can opt out of getting 
the periodic advance payments and receive a lump sum in spring 2022 as a
 credit when you file your taxes. You'll be able to use the online 
portal to opt out. Again, you wouldn't receive any money until 2022.</p><p>For more information, here are <span class="link" section="shortcodeLink"><a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/3600-child-tax-credit-for-2021-when-will-parents-get-their-money-5-things-you-should-know/">five things you should know about the $3,600 Child Tax Credit for 2021</a></span>.
