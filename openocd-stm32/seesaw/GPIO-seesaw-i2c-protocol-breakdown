GPIO
The GPIO module provides every day input and outputs. You'll get 3.3V logic GPIO pins that can act as outputs or
inputs. With pullups or pulldowns. When inputs, you can also create pin-change interrupts that are routed the the IRQ
pin.
The module base register address for the GPIO module is 0x01.
 Function Registers
Writes of GPIO function registers should contain 4 data bytes (32 bits) following the initial register data bytes. Each bit
in these registers represents a GPIO pin on PORTA of the seesaw device.
If the corresponding pin does not exist on the SeeSaw device, then reading or writing the bit has no effect.
We decided to go with this method to make GPIO toggling fast (rather than having one i2c transaction per individual
pin control) but the host processor will need to do a little work to keep the pins identified.

DIRSET (0x02, 32 bits, Write Only)
Writing a 1 to any bit in this register sets the direction of the corresponding pin to OUTPUT.
Writing zeros to this register has no effect.
DIRCLR (0x03, 32 bits, Write Only)
Writing a 1 to any bit in this register sets the direction of the corresponding pin to INPUT.
Writing zeros to this register has no effect.
GPIO (0x04, 32 bits, Read/Write)
When this register is written, all bits that are set to 0 will have their corresponding pins set LOW.
All bits that are set to 1 will have their corresponding pins set HIGH.
Reading this register reads all pins on PORTA of the seesaw device.
SET (0x05, 32 bits, Write Only)
Writing a 1 to any bit in this register writes the corresponding pin HIGH.
Writing zeros to this register has no effect.
CLR (0x06, 32 bits, Write Only)
Writing a 1 to any bit in this register writes the corresponding pin LOW.
Writing zeros to this register has no effect.
TOGGLE (0x07, 32 bits, Write Only)
Writing a 1 to any bit in this register toggles the corresponding pin.
Writing zeros to this register has no effect.
INTENSET (0x08, 32 bits, Write Only)
Writing a 1 to any bit in this register enables the interrupt on the corresponding pin. When the value on this pin
changes, the corresponding bit will be set in the INTFLAG register.
Writing zeros to this register has no effect.
INTENCLR (0x09, 32 bits, Write Only)
Writing a 1 to any bit in this register disables the interrupt on the corresponding pin.
Writing zeros to this register has no effect.
INTFLAG (0x0A, 32 bits, Read Only)
This register hold the status of all GPIO interrupts. When an interrupt fires, the corresponding bit in this register gets
set. Reading this register clears all interrupts.
PULLENSET (0x0B, 32 bits, Write Only)
Writing a 1 to any bit in this register enables the internal pullup or pulldown on the corresponding pin. The pull direction
(up/down) is determined by the GPIO (output) value - if the corresponding GPIO register bit is low,  its a pulldown.
High, its a pullup.
Writing zeros to this register has no effect.
PULLENCLR (0x0C, 32 bits, Write Only)
Writing a 1 to any bit in this register disables the pull up/down on the corresponding pin.
Writing zeros to this register has no effect.
