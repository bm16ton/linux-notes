##### BASE ADDR 0x09 ############

10-bit resolution. The seesaw has 4 ADC inputs.
The module base register address for the ADC is 0x09
Conversions can be read by reading the corresponding CHANNEL register.
When reading ADC data, there should be at least a 500 microsecond delay between writing the register number you would like to read from and attempting to read the data.
Allow a delay of at least 1ms in between sequential ADC reads on different channels.

ADC channels are:
Channel 0 PA02
Channel 1 PA03
Channel 2 PA04
Channel 3 PA05
