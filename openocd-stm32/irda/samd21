25.6.3.3  IrDA Modulation and Demodulation
IrDA modulation and demodulation is available with the following configuration. When enabled, transmission and
reception is IrDA compliant up to 115.2 kb/s.
z IrDA encoding enabled (CTRLB.ENC=1).
z Asynchronous mode (CTRLA.CMODE = 0).
z 16x sample rate (CTRLA.SAMPR[0] = 0).
During transmission, each low bit is transmitted as a high pulse with width as 3/16 of the baud rate period

The reception decoder has two main functions. The first is to synchronize the incoming data to the IrDA baud rate
counter. Synchronization is performed at the start of each zero pulse. The second function is to decode incoming Rx
data. If a pulse width meets the minimum length set by configuration (RXPL.RXPL), it is accepted. When the baud rate
counter reaches its middle value (1/2 bit length), it is transferred to the receiver.
Figure 25-9 illustrates reception where RXPL.RXPL is set to 19. This indicates that the pulse width should be at least 20
SE clock cycles.  When assuming BAUD = 0xE666 or 160 SE cycles per bit, this corresponds to 2/16 baud clock as
minimum pulse width required. In this case the first bit is accepted as a zero, the second bit is a one, and the third bit is
also a one. A low pulse is rejected since it does not meet the minimum requirement of 2/16 baud clock.

Note that the polarity of the transmitter and receiver are opposite. During transmission, a zero bit is transmitted as a one

pulse. During reception, an accepted zero pulse is received as a zero bit
