Command		Command							Description
0x00		COMMAND							This command is used to indicate the next data byte is acted as a command.
0x40~0x7F	Display Start Line				This command sets the Display Start Line register to determine the starting address of display RAM
0xAE		Display OFF						This command is used to turn OFF the OLED display panel.
0xAF		Display ON						This command is used to turn ON the OLED display panel.
0x20		Memory Addressing Mode			If horizontal address increment mode is enabled by command 20h, after finishing read/write one column data, it is incremented auto to the next column address.
0x26/0x27	Continuous Horizontal Scroll	0x26 – Right horizontal scroll
											0x27 – Left horizontal scroll
0x29/0x2A	Continuous Vertical 			0x2A – Vertical and Left Horizontal Scroll
			and Horizontal Scroll			0x29 – Vertical and Right Horizontal Scroll
0x2A – 		Vertical and Left Horizontal Scroll
0x2E		Deactivate Scroll				This command deactivates the scroll.
0x2F		Activate Scroll					This command activates the scroll if it is configured before.
0x21		Column Address					This command is used to define the current read/write column address in graphic display data RAM.
0x22		Page Address					This command is used to define the current read/write Line(Page as per data sheet) address in graphic display data RAM.
0x81		Contrast Control				This command sets the Contrast Setting of the display. The chip has 256 contrast steps from 00h to FFh. The segment output current increases as  value increases.
0xA0		Segment Re-map					This command sets the column address 0 is mapped to SEG0.
0xA1		Segment Re-map					This command sets the column address 127 is mapped to SEG0.

0xA8		Multiplex Ratio					This command sets the display multiplex ratio.
0xC0/0xC8	COM Output Scan direction		0xC0 – Normal mode (RESET) Scan from COM0 to COM[N –1]
											0xC8- Remapped mode. Scan from COM[N-1] to COM0 Where N is the Multiplex ratio.
0xC8- 		Remapped mode. 					Scan from COM[N-1] to COM0 Where N is the Multiplex ratio.
0xD3		Display Offset					This command sets vertical shift by COM from 0d~63d.
0xD5		Display Clock Divide Ratio/Oscillator Frequency
