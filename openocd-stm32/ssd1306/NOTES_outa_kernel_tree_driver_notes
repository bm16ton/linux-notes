i2c_smbus_read_block_data
Note that using this function requires that the clientâ€™s adapter support the I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_READ_BLOCK_DATA functionality.
Not all adapter drivers support this; its emulation through I2C messaging relies on a specific mechanism (I2C_M_RECV_LEN)
 which may not be implemented.
