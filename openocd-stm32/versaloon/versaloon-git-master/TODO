1. remove library from ST, reuse only the defines for registers
2. use same interface driver code for stm32 and vi_stm32
3. make interfaces calls non-block(for ebi, spi etc.)
4. make usart_stream standard dal_info_t driver
5. make param in dal_info_t constant, and info in dal_info_t volatile
	means parameter of a driver is constand, and info is used for variables
6. make address parameter in EBI interface correspond to the read signals in address port
7. in vsfusbd, remove all static variables
		---- done
