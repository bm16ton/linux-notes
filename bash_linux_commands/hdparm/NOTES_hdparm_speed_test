hdparm is a good place to start.

sudo hdparm -Tt /dev/sda

/dev/sda:
Timing cached reads:   12540 MB in  2.00 seconds = 6277.67 MB/sec
Timing buffered disk reads: 234 MB in  3.00 seconds =  77.98 MB/sec

sudo hdparm -v /dev/sda will give information as well.

dd will give you information on write speed.

If the drive doesn't have a file system (and only then), use of=/dev/sda.

Otherwise, mount it on /tmp and write then delete the test output file.

dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/output bs=8k count=10k; rm -f /tmp/output
